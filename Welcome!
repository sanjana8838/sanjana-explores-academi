# Welcome!

Hello internet! 
Having been a "blogger" for over 8 years now (thatindianblogger.blogspot.com), you would think that putting out words on a blog post is easier now.
I've always put out a very surface level introduction to myself on the internet, but as I am about to embark on a career in academia it is now time to put out a different introduction.
So, hello world!
I am Sanjana, an incoming graduate student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
I will be a Master of Science student in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering and will be specializing in Power Engineering.
I just graduated with a Bachelors degree in Electronic and Communication Engineering from Bangalore University and I ~~am all set~~ to embark on this brand new chapter of my life. I wanted to journal this chapter in hopes of not just cataloging the journey but to put out things I wasn't aware of for students far and wide. 
Coming out of undergrad, I realised one aspect that I sadly lacked in was just information. Information about applications, intership/research opportunities and much more.
I could blame a whole lot of entities for this, but instead I wanted to put together my own list of sources, information, tips, reviews, projects and a whole lot more on just one platform.
I cannot tell you how excited I am for this journey, and I hope to see you join me along the way.
